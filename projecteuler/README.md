# Project Euler
- Runnable code, mostly in Haskell;
- Only the first 100, as permited by the rules


| Problem | Strategy                                 | 
| --------|:----------------------------------------:| 
| 1       | trivial / brute-force                    | 
| 2       | progression (not implemented)            |  
| 3       | reverse search, pruned prime search      | 
| 4       | linear search, lots of prunning          | 
| 5       | search forwards, considering numbers from  11 to  20 | 
| 6       | find polynomial behind the logic, via Lagrange interpolation (this was done in Python, then apply polynomial to large number) | 
| 7       | brute forced so far, need to find some smart sieving approach |
