# Competitive programming

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises and problems from various competitive programming platforms, solved by the repository owner. The solutions are primarily written in C and Python, with a focus on ACM/ICPC format problems. Additionally, some Project Euler problems are solved using Haskell for a more functional programming approach.

The solutions can be related to the following user profiles on competitive programming platforms:
- SPOJ: [la_pt](http://www.spoj.com/users/la_pt/)
- Codeforces: [leonardoandrade](https://codeforces.com/profile/leonardoandrade)

## Project Euler Problems üßÆ

The repository includes solutions for the first 100 problems from Project Euler, as allowed by the rules of the platform. The solutions are implemented mainly in Haskell, with some use of Python for specific tasks such as polynomial interpolation. The problems cover a variety of mathematical concepts and require different strategies, from brute-force to more sophisticated algorithms.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To run the Haskell programs for Project Euler problems, you'll need to have a Haskell compiler installed, such as GHC. For the Python scripts, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

For C programs, a standard C compiler like `gcc` is required. Make sure to compile the C programs with the appropriate flags before running them.

## Summary of Latest Changes üîÑ

The latest commits indicate work on problem 7 from Project Euler, as well as documentation updates and the addition of more Project Euler solutions.

## TODOS üìù

- Implement memoization for faster execution of recursive functions, particularly in the Project Euler solutions.
- Add more comments to the code for better understanding and maintainability.
- Consider refactoring some of the solutions to improve performance and reduce complexity.
- Ensure that all solutions are thoroughly tested against edge cases and large input sizes.
